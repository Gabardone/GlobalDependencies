/**
 Global Dependencies container. Contains all declared global dependencies and manages overrides of them.

 See the documentation for `Dependencies` for a full explanation of the usage patterns. This type encompasses all of
 the app's dependencies so it gets passed around as an overarching type, which then gets filtered into specific needed
 dependencies within components.

 `GlobalDependencies` is also in charge of dependency overrides. When needing to override a dependency you just build
 another value of the type and add the needed overrides. Since these are passed around and built on top of the current
 one in hand for the component doing the work, the overridden dependency will stick around even if child components
 don't have visibility to it.

/**
 Implements a dependency on the `GlobalDependencies` type.

 Since Swift macros, as of Swift 5.9, cannot declare extensions, this macro will be invoked _inside_ a manually declared
  `extension GlobalDependencies: MyProtocol.Dependency`. And since the macro doesn't have access to its contextual
 semantics you'll have to repeat the protocol name (`MyProtocol` in this contrived example) in the corresponding
 parameter of the macro ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
 - Parameters
   - type: Type of the dependency. Should be the same as the property vended by the dependency protocol that the
 extension is adopting.
   - lowercased: Name of the dependency accessor property. You only need to pass a value if it is different than `type`
 with its first letter lowercased.
